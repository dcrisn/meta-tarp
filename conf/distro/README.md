Distros:

* tarplite
The most lightweight distro configuration. Most things removed, very bare-bones,
good for a clean base to use for testing or further customization.

* tarpaulin
Complete distro with more powerful features. Much more significant memory
footprint; systemd is used instead of busybox-init, etc.
